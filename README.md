## Introduction

Hello everyone,

In this guide, I‚Äôll show you how to install and test NVIDIA‚Äôs CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN on your Windows machine.

First, let‚Äôs briefly explain what these technologies are:

**CUDA** (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA that lets you harness the massive parallel processing power of your GPU for general-purpose computing. With CUDA, compute-intensive applications‚Äîfrom scientific simulations to AI workloads‚Äîcan achieve major speedups.

**cuDNN** (CUDA Deep Neural Network Library) is a GPU-accelerated library of highly tuned routines for deep learning. Developed by NVIDIA, cuDNN optimizes the training and inference of neural networks and integrates seamlessly with popular frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, squeezing out maximum performance from your GPU.

When used together, CUDA and cuDNN deliver substantial performance boosts for AI and deep learning projects‚Äîhelping researchers and engineers iterate faster and deploy more powerful models.

> **Prerequisite:** You‚Äôll need an NVIDIA GPU with the correct drivers installed. In the next section we‚Äôll verify your driver‚Äôs CUDA compatibility.

üîç Check NVIDIA Driver & CUDA Compatibility

Open a terminal (PowerShell or CMD) and run:

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

You should see output similar to this:

The ‚ÄúCUDA Version‚Äù column shows which CUDA release your current NVIDIA driver supports. Use this information to pick the matching CUDA Toolkit installer in the next step.

In the top row of the NVIDIA-SMI output (on the right side), you‚Äôll see your current GPU driver and the CUDA version it supports.

## üèóÔ∏è Install Visual Studio

Before you install CUDA, download **Visual Studio 2022 Community** from  
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/

When running the installer, select the **‚ÄúDesktop development with C++‚Äù** workload (no other components are required). You can proceed with all the default options.

Once the installation finishes, close Visual Studio and move on to the CUDA installation.

## üöÄ Download & Install CUDA Toolkit

1. Open your browser and go to the CUDA Toolkit Archive:  
   https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive  

![1_ITtF5ydbL2IYDqO1MLMkQw](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d44bfb8-b722-482d-9c93-49f56c2d29da)

2. From the list of releases, choose the CUDA version that matches your driver‚Äôs supported CUDA (e.g. **CUDA 12.4**).  
   *Tip:* Minor patch numbers (e.g. 12.4.x) rarely introduce incompatibilities, so you can safely pick the latest 12.4.x.

3. Select **Windows ‚Üí x86_64 ‚Üí exe (local)** and download the installer (~3 GB).

4. Run the `.exe` with all **default options** to complete the CUDA installation.

3. On the download page, select the options that match your system:
   - **Operating System:** Windows  
   - **Architecture:** x86_64  
   - **Installer Type:** exe (local)

   The `.exe` file is roughly **3 GB** ‚Äî save it locally before proceeding.

5. After the download completes, double-click the `.exe` file to launch the installer.

   During installation, you don‚Äôt need to change any settings‚Äîjust proceed with all default options until it finishes. You should see screens similar to this:

## ‚öôÔ∏è Set Environment Variables

1. In the Windows search bar, type **"Edit the system environment variables"** and open it:  

2. In the **System Properties** window, click the **‚ÄúEnvironment Variables‚Ä¶‚Äù** button in the bottom-right corner.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Set Environment Variables

1. Open **System Properties**:  
   - Press Start and search for **‚ÄúSystem Environment Variables‚Äù**, then select **‚ÄúEdit the system environment variables‚Äù**.  
   - In the dialog that appears, click **Environment Variables‚Ä¶** in the bottom-right.

3. In the **Edit environment variable** window, make sure the following CUDA paths (replace `v12.4` with your installed version) are present. If any are missing, click **New** and add them:

```bash
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.4\bin
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.4\libnvvp
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.4\include
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.4\lib\x64
```

4. Click **OK** on all dialogs, then **restart** your PC.

After rebooting, you‚Äôre ready to verify that CUDA is installed correctly.


## ‚úîÔ∏è Verify CUDA Installation

After rebooting your PC, open a terminal (PowerShell or CMD) and run:

```bash
nvcc --version
```

You should see output similar to this:

For example:

```bash
nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver
Cuda compilation tools, release 12.4, V12.4.131
```

If you see your CUDA version listed, congratulations‚ÄîCUDA is installed correctly!
